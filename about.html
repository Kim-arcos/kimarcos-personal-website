            <!--not my picture but will put my picture soon-->
            <p>I've always been co-chef to my mom growing up. I started cooking on my own since I was 13 years old and my skills and recipes have really improved and broadened. I like to take inspirtation from the internet and follow other peoples recipes. Changing them a bit to add my own spice.</p>
            <p>I perfer to make food at home, because when it comes down to it, it is a lot healthier and cheaper. Even though most of my recipes are mexican styled, I like to make pasta with homemade sauce. The only thing I think that I can't make would be my mother's salsa. Her's is so good and always has the perfect amount of heat.</p>

            <!--not my picture but will put my picture soon-->
            <p>I've been in each of my schools bands since I was in third grade. I learned to play violin, saxophone, clarinet, guitar, and the piano. I like to listen to classical pieces by Vivaldi and Beethoven when I'm cleaning or relaxing. </p>
            <p>When I was in school I took advantage of the free lessons and practice time after school. I learned a lot and was able to improve my music skills drastically. Even though I don't play as much as I use to, I still like to pick up my guitar and learn some new songs. I even started to teach my siblings how to play the piano.</p>

          <!--not my picture but will put my picture soon-->
          <p>I like to work out on my non-work days. I try to aim to going to the gym three times a week. On the days that I can't go, I still squeeze a workout in at home. Over the years I've bought some dumbbells and other gym equipment for that purpose.</p>
          <p>Going to the gym and staying consistent has really improved my mental and physical health. I feel great and have energy throughout my entire day. It also improves my eating habits. </p>
